1. Differentiate Flowchart & Algorithm.

  Flowchart
  -A flowchart is a graphical representation of the steps a program takes to process data. In this, we can use several geometric patterns to illustrate the numerous actions the program carries out.
  
  Algorithm
  -An algorithm is a procedure or set of rules that defines how a program is to be executed.
  
2. Discuss the brief history of flowchart.
  -In the 1920s and 1930s, flowcharts were used to document business processes.Frank and Lillian Gilbreth, industrial engineers, presented the "Flow Process Chart" to the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) in 1921.Industrial engineer Allan H. Morgensen used Gilbreth's tools in the early 1930s to teach businesspeople at his company how to make work more efficient.Art Spinanger and Ben S. Graham, two students of Morgensen, made the methods more widely known in the 1940s.Procter and Gamble adopted the work simplification techniques from Spinanger.Standard Register Industrial director Graham applied flow process charts to information processing.A symbol system for flow process charts developed by the Gilbreths was adopted by ASME in 1947.
